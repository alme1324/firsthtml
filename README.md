My first HTML Project
=========

This is my first project on front-end development.
Front-end development mainly constitutes of use of technologies in order to design the appearance of website.
As we all know, first impression is all that decides the journey of user in the website.

#### Technologies Used :
1. HTML 
2. CSS 
3. Java Script

In this project,
I tried to implement a simple javaScript game for rolling a dice. It will be a combination of various front-end technologies like css, html, JS, JQuery etc.
There will be three tabs in the screen inside this game, whose description is as follows.
1. Dice Game  = This section is the place where the real game resides. User can click it and the game page will open inside which user can play the game.
2. HighScore  = This section shows the highscore made by user untill now.
3. Register   = The section specifies the registration of user so that user can also connect to other players over internet on future development of the game.

Note : This project is still under development phase and further information will be updated soon.
